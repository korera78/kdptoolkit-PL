# H1: The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog

This is a standard paragraph. The purpose of this post is to validate the **typography** and *styling* of the blog. We want to ensure that all elements render correctly and look professional.

## H2: Typography Checks

This section tests various inline styles:
- **Bold Text**: Strong emphasis.
- *Italic Text*: Subtle emphasis.
- `Inline Code`: For technical terms like `process.env`.

2.  Second item
3.  Third item with nested list:

## H2: Code Blocks

Here is a Python code block with syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True
```

And a JavaScript block:

```javascript
const styles = {
  container: "max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4",
  heading: "text-3xl font-bold mb-4"
};
```
